## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Kiro CLI](https://kiro.dev/cli/) installed and logged in with AWS SSO (Builder ID)

### Installation via Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
# Add the tap
brew tap if414013/tvps

# Install kiro-gateway
brew install kiro-gateway

# Run (interactive setup on first run)
kiro-gateway
```

### Installation from Source

Requires Rust 1.75+ (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/if414013/rkgw.git
cd rkgw

# Build release binary
cargo build --release

# Run
./target/release/kiro-gateway
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:8000` or `https://localhost:8000` if TLS is enabled.

🔒 **Default Binding:** The gateway defaults to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only) for security. To allow network access, use `--host 0.0.0.0 --tls`. See the [Security](#-security) section for details.

To enable HTTPS with an auto-generated self-signed certificate:

```bash
kiro-gateway --tls
```

The server will be available at `https://localhost:8000`.

> **Note:** The auto-generated self-signed certificate only covers `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and `::1`. If you bind to a network address with `--host 0.0.0.0` and clients connect via a LAN IP or hostname, they will see certificate name mismatch errors. For network access, provide your own certificate with `--tls-cert` and `--tls-key` that includes the appropriate SANs.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

On first run, `kiro-gateway` will guide you through an interactive setup if no `.env` file is found. It will:

- Prompt for a password to protect your gateway
- Auto-detect your kiro-cli database location
- Let you choose the AWS region
- Optionally save the configuration to a `.env` file

### Manual Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Required - Path to kiro-cli SQLite database
KIRO_CLI_DB_FILE="~/Library/Application Support/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3"

# Password to protect YOUR proxy server
PROXY_API_KEY="my-super-secret-password-123"

# Optional
KIRO_REGION="us-east-1"

# Server binding (optional, defaults to 127.0.0.1:8000 for local-only access)
# For network access: SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 (requires --tls flag)
# SERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1
# SERVER_PORT=8000

# TLS / HTTPS (optional)
# TLS_ENABLED=true
# TLS_CERT=/path/to/cert.pem
# TLS_KEY=/path/to/key.pem
```

### HTTPS / TLS

The gateway supports HTTPS out of the box with three usage modes:

**1. Auto-generated self-signed certificate** — just add `--tls`:

```bash
kiro-gateway --tls
```

A self-signed certificate is generated automatically and saved to `~/.kiro-gateway/tls/` for reuse across restarts. Certificates are valid for 365 days and are automatically regenerated before expiry.

> ⚠️ Self-signed certificates are not trusted by browsers and clients by default. Use `--tls-cert` and `--tls-key` for production deployments.

**2. Custom certificate** — provide your own PEM files:

```bash
kiro-gateway --tls --tls-cert /path/to/cert.pem --tls-key /path/to/key.pem
```

**3. Auto-enable via cert/key** — TLS activates automatically when both paths are provided:

```bash
kiro-gateway --tls-cert /path/to/cert.pem --tls-key /path/to/key.pem
```

All options also work via environment variables: `TLS_ENABLED`, `TLS_CERT`, `TLS_KEY`.

| CLI Flag       | Environment Variable | Description                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `--tls`        | `TLS_ENABLED`        | Enable HTTPS (auto-generates cert if none given) |
| `--tls-cert`   | `TLS_CERT`           | Path to TLS certificate file (PEM format)        |
| `--tls-key`    | `TLS_KEY`            | Path to TLS private key file (PEM format)        |

### Kiro CLI Database Locations

The gateway auto-detects the kiro-cli database from these common locations:

| Platform        | Path                                                  |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **macOS**       | `~/Library/Application Support/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3` |
| **Linux**       | `~/.local/share/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3`                |
| **macOS (old)** | `~/Library/Application Support/kiro-cli/data.db`      |
| **Legacy**      | `~/.kiro/data.db`                                     |

The gateway reads credentials from the kiro-cli SQLite database and automatically refreshes tokens before expiration.

---

## 🔒 Security

### Server Binding

**Local-only use (127.0.0.1 - Recommended for personal use)**

When you bind to `127.0.0.1` (localhost), the gateway is only accessible from your local machine. This is the safest option for personal development and testing.

```bash
kiro-gateway --host 127.0.0.1
```

✅ **Secure by Default:** The gateway defaults to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only). This is the recommended setting for personal use.

**Network-accessible use (0.0.0.0 - Use with caution)**

Binding to `0.0.0.0` exposes the gateway to all network interfaces, making it accessible from other devices on your local network or potentially the internet if your firewall allows it.

```bash
kiro-gateway --host 0.0.0.0
```

⚠️ **Security implications:**
- Anyone on your network can access the gateway if they know your IP address and port
- Traffic is unencrypted by default (HTTP), exposing your API key and data in plain text
- The `PROXY_API_KEY` is your only protection against unauthorized access
- If port-forwarded or exposed to the internet, anyone can attempt to access your gateway

**If you must use 0.0.0.0, always enable TLS:**

```bash
kiro-gateway --host 0.0.0.0 --tls
```

This encrypts all traffic between clients and the gateway, protecting your credentials and data from network sniffing.

🛡️ **Enforcement:** The gateway enforces TLS for non-localhost bindings. If you attempt to start with `0.0.0.0` or another non-localhost address without TLS, the gateway will refuse to start with an error:

> Error: TLS is required when binding to non-localhost addresses (current: 0.0.0.0). Either enable TLS with --tls flag, or bind to localhost with --host 127.0.0.1

This validation prevents accidental exposure of unencrypted traffic to your network.

### Trusting Self-Signed Certificates (macOS)

When using `--tls` without custom certificates, the gateway generates a self-signed certificate saved to `~/.kiro-gateway/tls/`. Clients will not trust this certificate by default, resulting in connection errors.

**GUI Method (Keychain Access):**

1. Open **Keychain Access** application
2. Select the **System** keychain in the left sidebar
3. Drag the certificate file from `~/.kiro-gateway/tls/` into the Keychain Access window
4. Double-click the imported certificate entry
5. Expand the **Trust** section
6. Set **When using this certificate** to **Always Trust**
7. Close the dialog and enter your admin password when prompted

**CLI Method (Terminal):**

```bash
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain ~/.kiro-gateway/tls/cert.pem
```

Replace `cert.pem` with the actual certificate filename in your `~/.kiro-gateway/tls/` directory.

> 💡 **Tip:** After trusting the certificate, restart your client application to ensure it picks up the new trust settings. For curl, you can also use the `-k` flag to skip certificate verification during testing.

## 🖥️ OpenCode Setup

<details>
<summary>View OpenCode configuration</summary>

To use this gateway with [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), add the following provider configuration to your global config file at `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`. This makes the Kiro provider available across all your projects.

For more details on OpenCode configuration, see the [OpenCode Config Documentation](https://opencode.ai/docs/config/).

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a3ab9ba-15b4-4b96-95df-158602ed08b0

### Tested Model Limits

Limits below were empirically tested using `probe_limits` against a live Kiro gateway (see [docs/probe-limits.md](docs/probe-limits.md)):

| Model               | Context (tokens) | Max output tokens | Notes                              |
| ------------------- | :--------------: | :---------------: | ---------------------------------- |
| `claude-opus-4.6`   | ~195K            | unknown           | Output probe errored (thinking mode interference) |
| `claude-sonnet-4.6` | ~195K            | unknown           | Model stopped early — disable thinking to re-probe |
| `claude-haiku-4.5`  | ~195K            | unknown           | Model stopped early — disable thinking to re-probe |

> Output token cap is unknown because the gateway has thinking mode enabled by default. Restart with `FAKE_REASONING=false` and re-run `probe_limits` to get accurate output caps. Anthropic's documented standard limit is **8192 tokens** for all Claude 4.x models.

## 🚧 Known Limitations

<details>
<summary>View known limitations</summary>

### Web Search in Claude Code

Claude Code's built-in Web Search tool doesn't work through this proxy. The Kiro backend API doesn't support the `tool_use`/`tool_result` round-trip cycle that Claude Code's native tools rely on, so web search requests will fail.

**Workaround: Use MCP servers instead**

MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools run locally on your machine, so they bypass the proxy entirely. Add the following to your `~/.claude.json` under `"mcpServers"`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fetch": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"],
      "env": {},
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    },
    "exa": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "exa-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "EXA_API_KEY": "your-exa-api-key"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

| MCP Server | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `mcp-server-fetch` | Fetches and extracts content from any URL |
| `exa-mcp-server` | AI-powered web search via [Exa](https://exa.ai/) (requires an API key) |

> 💡 After adding these, restart Claude Code to pick up the new MCP configuration.
