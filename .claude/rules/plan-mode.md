# Plan Mode Rules

Applies when Claude Code is in Plan mode.

## Mandatory Agent Consultation

Before writing any non-trivial plan, you MUST consult domain agents for feasibility and scope input. This is not optional — plans written without agent consultation will miss implementation details.

### Step 1: Identify affected services

Use the Service Map in CLAUDE.md to determine which domains the task touches.

### Step 2: Spawn all domain agents for consultation

Spawn all 7 domain agents via `TeamCreate` + `Agent`. Each agent investigates from its domain perspective:

| Affected Service | Agent to Consult | What to Ask |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Backend (Rust/Axum) | `rust-backend-engineer` | Existing patterns, affected modules, type changes, error handling approach |
| Frontend (React/TS) | `react-frontend-engineer` | Component structure, API integration points, styling approach, state management |
| Infrastructure | `devops-engineer` | Docker impact, env vars, deployment changes |
| Database | `database-engineer` | Schema impact, migration needs, query patterns |
| Backend tests | `backend-qa` | Test coverage gaps, which test patterns to follow, integration test needs |
| Frontend tests | `frontend-qa` | E2E test scenarios, Playwright page objects to update |
| Documentation | `document-writer` | Documentation gaps, API doc updates needed |

Prompt template for each consultant:
```
Read .claude/agents/{agent}.md for your role context, then investigate:
1. What existing code/patterns are relevant to: {task description}
2. What files would need to change?
3. What risks or gotchas should the plan account for?
4. Estimated complexity (small/medium/large)?
```

### Step 3: Clarify ambiguities with the user

After gathering agent findings, identify any open questions before writing the plan. Use AskUserQuestion to resolve ambiguities — do NOT make assumptions. Common things to clarify:

- Scope boundaries (e.g., "Should this also handle X, or just Y?")
- Design trade-offs surfaced by agents (e.g., "Agent found two approaches — A is simpler, B is more extensible. Which do you prefer?")
- Missing requirements (e.g., "Should this support streaming, or non-streaming only?")
- Priority conflicts (e.g., "This touches auth and config — which should we tackle first?")

If the task is unambiguous and agent findings don't raise questions, skip this step. But when in doubt, ask — a 30-second clarification beats rewriting a plan.

### Step 4: Incorporate findings into the plan

The plan MUST reference specific findings from each consultant. Include a "Consultation Summary" section listing what each agent reported and how it influenced the plan.

## Plan Output Format

Every non-trivial plan must include:
1. **Consultation Summary** — what each domain agent reported
2. **Agent Assignment** — maps tasks to agents:

### Task Decomposition

Structure tasks in waves for parallel execution:

- **Wave 1** (foundations): Backend types, DB migrations, core logic
  - Assigned to: `rust-backend-engineer`
- **Wave 2** (consumers): Frontend pages, API integration
  - Assigned to: `react-frontend-engineer`
- **Wave 3** (verification): Unit tests, E2E tests
  - Assigned to: `backend-qa`, `frontend-qa`

### File Ownership

Assign each file to exactly one agent. No overlaps.

## Rules Reference

Read `.claude/rules/*.md` to ensure plans follow project conventions:
- `backend.md` — Rust/Axum patterns, error handling, testing
- `web-ui.md` — React 19, TypeScript, CRT aesthetic, API patterns
