description: Reference guide for creating, managing, and completing Conductor tracks — the logical work units for features, bugs, and refactors. Use when user asks 'how do tracks work', 'track lifecycle', 'what status markers mean', or 'track sizing guidelines'. Do NOT use to take action on tracks (use conductor-manage).

# Track Management Reference

## 1. Track Concept

A **track** is the atomic unit of planned work in Conductor. Each track represents a single deliverable — a feature, bug fix, chore, or refactor — with its own specification, implementation plan, and completion criteria.

Tracks live under `conductor/tracks/{track-id}/` and contain:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `spec.md` | Requirements, acceptance criteria, scope boundaries |
| `plan.md` | Phased implementation plan with atomic tasks |
| `metadata.json` | Machine-readable track state |

---

## 2. Track Types

| Type | When to Use | rkgw Examples |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `feature` | New capability or user-facing functionality | Add MCP tool caching, new guardrails rule type, Anthropic vision support |
| `bug` | Incorrect behavior that needs correction | Streaming parser truncation on large responses, token cache race condition |
| `chore` | Maintenance, dependency updates, config changes | Upgrade Axum 0.8, add new model alias, rotate API keys |
| `refactor` | Structural improvement without behavior change | Extract converter shared logic, refactor auth module, consolidate error types |

---

## 3. Track ID Format

Format: `{shortname}_{YYYYMMDD}` where `{shortname}` is a lowercase hyphenated slug derived from the track title (2-4 key words, under 30 characters) and `{YYYYMMDD}` is the creation date. Examples: `mcp-tool-caching_20260306`, `streaming-truncation_20260305`. IDs are never reused. On collision, append a numeric suffix (e.g., `-2`).

---

## 4. Track Lifecycle

```
draft → in_progress → completed / abandoned
```

---

## 5. Status Markers

| Marker | Name | Meaning | Example |
|--------|------|---------|---------|
| `[ ]` | Pending | Not started | `[ ] 1.1: Add streaming event type` |
| `[~]` | In Progress | Currently being worked | `[~] 1.2: Implement converter logic` |
| `[x]` | Complete | Finished — **must include commit SHA** | `[x] 1.3: Add unit tests \`a1b2c3d\`` |
| `[-]` | Skipped | Intentionally not done — **must include reason** | `[-] 1.4: Add Docker healthcheck (not needed)` |
| `[!]` | Blocked | Waiting on dependency — **must include blocker** | `[!] 2.1: Frontend integration (waiting on 1.3)` |

### Rules

- Only **one** task should be `[~]` per agent at a time.
- Never leave a task `[~]` across sessions.
- The commit SHA in `[x]` entries enables precise rollback.

## 6. Spec Quality Checklist

- [ ] **Requirements are testable**
- [ ] **Scope is clear** — explicit in/out of scope sections
- [ ] **Dependencies identified**
- [ ] **Risks addressed** — failure modes, rollback strategy
- [ ] **API contract defined** — request/response shapes for new endpoints
- [ ] **Migration strategy** — for existing data if schema changes

---

## 7. Plan Quality Checklist

- [ ] **Tasks are atomic** — each is a single committable unit
- [ ] **Phases are logical** — grouped by layer (backend → frontend → infra → QA)
- [ ] **Verification after each phase**
- [ ] **All spec requirements covered**
- [ ] **Dependencies ordered correctly**
- [ ] **No ambiguous tasks**

---

## 8. Track Sizing Guidelines

| Metric | Target Range |
|--------|-------------|
| Duration | 1-5 working days |
| Phases | 2-4 |
| Tasks per phase | 3-6 |
| Total tasks | 8-20 |

## 9. Common Track Patterns for rkgw

### Feature Track (Full-Stack)

```
Phase 1: Backend
  [ ] 1.1: Add request/response types
  [ ] 1.2: Implement business logic
  [ ] 1.3: Add route handler
  [ ] 1.4: Write unit tests

Phase 2: Frontend
  [ ] 2.1: Add API integration
  [ ] 2.2: Build UI component/page
  [ ] 2.3: Add styling

Phase 3: QA
  [ ] 3.1: Backend test coverage
  [ ] 3.2: E2E browser tests
```

### Bug Fix Track

```
Phase 1: Reproduction
  [ ] 1.1: Write failing test
  [ ] 1.2: Identify root cause

Phase 2: Fix & Verification
  [ ] 2.1: Implement fix
  [ ] 2.2: Verify test passes
  [ ] 2.3: Add regression guard
```

### Refactor Track

```
Phase 1: Characterization
  [ ] 1.1: Write characterization tests
  [ ] 1.2: Document current architecture

Phase 2: Incremental Refactor
  [ ] 2.1: Extract interface/abstraction
  [ ] 2.2: Migrate consumers
  [ ] 2.3: Verify tests pass

Phase 3: Cleanup
  [ ] 3.1: Remove old code
  [ ] 3.2: Update documentation
```
